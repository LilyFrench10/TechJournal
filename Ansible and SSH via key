ANSIBLE
mkdir -p ansible/roles
this is where your installed roles and yml files will go

to run a playbook in ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt roles/ymlfile.yml
#inventory.txt is a file in the ansible directory that contains hosts and properties 
#for windows add -u and the user@domain at the end

to use most playbooks you need to install the role that is called in the yml file
ansible galaxy can be used to find roles to download and their documentation
