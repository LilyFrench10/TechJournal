For ssh key login, the client (the user doing the ssh) needs to have the private and public key on the user sshing from, and 
the user account on the server needs the public key only. 

to only allow ssh via key edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config,
change PubKeyAuthentication to yes 
PasswordAuthentication no 
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no 
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys, and ensure the public key is stoed in the authorized_key file

ensure the proper permissions are set 

chmod 700 /.ssh
chmod 600 to authorized keys
ensure owner is account ssh into
ex: sudo chown -R sys265:sys265 /home/sys265/.ssh when ssh into sys265



GIT
git clone https://github/direct/link/to/page

(for these use the email/name associated with the account)
git config user.email name@email to set email
git config user.name username to set username 

To change file in git you must have the file changed, do git add . , make a git commit message “git commit -m “text”, and git push

git pull, updates the git repository in your system from the github page
 password authentication does not work, use git key for password, easier using ssh onto a linux system since you can copy and paste
